# Financial Notes
Miscellaneous notes crafted for Master studies (01/2025-TBA). The main folder is `notes` where each note has some of its contents ingesting from `scripts` and `images`. This repo is still being actively populated.

This repository is <u>not</u> meant to be complex. Just a collection of notes and implementations.

## Running Scripts
If you would like to run a script, here is an outlined basic guideline.

### Getting Started
1. Ensure installed Python is version 3.9 or higher
   ```shell
   python --version
   ```
2. Clone the repo
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/abyoso-hapsoro/financial-notes.git
   ```
3. Install requirements (optional)
   ```shell
   pip install -U -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Syntax
Run a Python script with file name "{file}.py".
```shell
$ python scripts/{file}.py
```

## Contributing
This repository is semi-open for contribution. Any new topics to cover (based on my learning journey) I would like to handle the initial commit(s) myself. Why? Because it's good practice to fully learn the materials!

So what is open?
1. If my understanding on an existing topic in the repository isn't quite right, then you are free to open an issue and/or submit a Pull Request to resolve that misconception.
2. You may also resolve any open issues or fix any problem found in scripts.
